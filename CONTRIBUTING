## General Advice

Try to make your solutions as explanatory as possible. Since Abbott wrote this
textbook to be very easy to read, it would also be nice for the solutions to be
an easy read as well.

Some guidelines:
 
 - Please use good LaTeX coding practices
 - Please use good coding guidelines, e.g. proper use of brackets, indentation, coding style etc.
 - Use `definitions`, `lemmas`, `theorems` where appropriate
 - If you need to label equations, try to use names that will not likely be used again
