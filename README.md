# Understanding Analysis Solutions

These are unofficial solutions for [_Understanding Analysis_ by Abbott](https://amzn.to/3O6SccG).
From [#3](https://github.com/mikinty/Understanding-Analysis-Abbott-Solutions/issues/3), I think we've agreed that these are for the 1st Edition. 
For the second edition solutions, please look for forks by other contributors; [solutions by `ulissemini`](https://github.com/ulissemini/understanding-analysis-solutions) mentioned in [#3](https://github.com/mikinty/Understanding-Analysis-Abbott-Solutions/issues/3) might be your best bet.
I started these solutions since I was self-studying real analysis,
and felt that I might as well give the problems an effort by writing
out solutions.

The PDF is located in the [`build/`](https://github.com/mikinty/Understanding-Analysis-Abbott-Solutions/blob/master/build/main.pdf)
folder of the repo.

If you want to contribute, feel free to fork and submit a PR!

Lastly, if you found this guide helpful, consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mikinty)!

## Why should I read this?

While the official solutions may be more accurate, they may be dense and hard
to understand, so a different perspective may help. In addition, my solutions
were done mostly independently of the official solutions, so it may be useful
to see how a student tries to approach problems.

I've also provided diagrams for certain problems, which can also help
understand more complex topics. Some sections have some introductory text, which further explains certain
topics. Typos are also noted.

There is also an appendix, which highlights several important theorems,
identities, and proof-writing tips. It can be used as a study guide for
current students taking Real Analysis.

## Beyond

After this intro Analysis course, "Baby Rudin" aka [Principles of Mathematical Analysis](https://amzn.to/3OqxhkB) is probably your best bet. I'm currently working on [solutions to that text](https://github.com/mikinty/Baby-Rudin-Solutions).

Studying Topology is also a good way to continue the education past analysis, and [Topology by Munkres](https://amzn.to/3HFIdsj) is a classic text in this regard. I'm working on those [solutions here](https://github.com/mikinty/Topology-Munkres-Solutions) (but beware I'm prioritizing work on Baby Rudin first).

I also [wrote solutions](https://github.com/mikinty/Axler-Linear-Algebra-Solutions) to [Linear Algebra Done Right by Axler](https://amzn.to/3xYTNdP).

## TODOs

I use `\TODO` to mark the problems that need work or don't have solutions.
There are also `TODO` comments if there are more minor parts that need work, e.g. spacing or prettier formatting.
